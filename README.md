# pyRoCS

This software package is designed to support analysis evaluating Resilience of Complex Systems (RoCS). Resilience is the ability of the complex system being analyzed to withstand, operate through, and recover from a disruption. The complex system may be a physical system such as an electric grid, an organization such as a company, or even a subfunction of an organization. Existing mathematical equations for resilience analysis are found within multiple domains including information theory, biological sciences, and complex systems. This package synthesizes and refactors equations from these various domains to make them more generalizable for application across different types of complex systems relevant for resilience analysis. Users will be able to apply these equations to characterize different components of complex systems based on available data.  

The pyRoCS package includes mathematical formulations of equations from three different domains including information theory, biosciences, and complex systems. The information theory equations include formulations of entropy; Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD); novelty, transience, and resonance (NTR); and mutual information. The biosciences equations include formulations of Hill diversity, affinity, and functional redundancy. Lastly, the complex systems equations include formulations of global reaching centrality, cyclomatic complexity, and fluctuating complexity. While these equations are applicable within their specific domains, they can also be applied to resilience analysis of any complex system. Accordingly, their formulations and associated documentation have been generalized in this package to apply across domains. Some of the metrics modifications made for pyRoCS package include: exposing more inputs to the user and enabling them to be implemented with different types of data structures than currently available in scipy (information theory equations), converting equations within the literature into a formal python-based software environment (biosciences and complex system equations). Associated literature that describes the origins of all of the pyRoCS equations are included in the documentation. The package also contains example datasets and tutorials to help demonstrate how the functions can be used.

Note: 'XX' indicate details that will be updated as the package is transferred to its final destination.
