Overview
============
This software package is designed to support analysis evaluating Resilience 
of Complex Systems (RoCS). Resilience is the ability of the complex system 
being analyzed to withstand, operate through, and recover from a disruption. 
The complex system may be a physical system such as an electric grid, 
an organization such as a company, or even a subfunction of an organization. 
Existing mathematical equations for resilience analysis are found within 
multiple domains including information theory, biological sciences, 
and complex systems. This package synthesizes and refactors equations 
from these various domains to make them more generalizable for 
application across different types of complex systems relevant 
for resilience analysis. Users will be able to apply these 
equations to characterize different components of complex 
systems based on available data.  

The pyRoCS package includes mathematical formulations of equations from 
three different domains including information theory, biosciences, and 
complex systems. The information theory equations include formulations of 
entropy; Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD); novelty, transience, and 
resonance (NTR); and mutual information. The biosciences equations include 
formulations of Hill diversity, affinity, and functional redundancy. 
Lastly, the complex systems equations include formulations of global 
reaching centrality, cyclomatic complexity, and fluctuating complexity. 
While these equations are applicable within their specific domains, 
they can also be applied to resilience analysis of any complex system. 
Accordingly, their formulations and associated documentation have 
been generalized in this package to apply across domains. Some of 
the metrics modifications made for pyRoCS package include: exposing 
more inputs to the user and enabling them to be implemented with 
different types of data structures than currently available in scipy 
(information theory equations), converting equations within the 
literature into a formal python-based software environment (biosciences 
and complex system equations). Associated literature that describes 
the origins of all of the pyRoCS equations are included in the 
documentation. The package also contains example datasets and 
tutorials to help demonstrate how the functions can be used.

To get started, we recommend exploring the pyrocs :ref:`tutorials<tutorials>`.
