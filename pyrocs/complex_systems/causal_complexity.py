    complexity values indicate that the content has fewer interconnections

    higher cyclomatic complexity values).

def causal_complexity(A: np.ndarray, directed : bool = False) -> float:
    '''
    Causal complexity measures the underlying causal structure 
    of a system by considering both the systemâ€™s intricacy as
    well as interconnectedness. The equation within the package 
    follows the formulations from
    :cite:p:`naugle_feedback_2023`,
    who generate a non-normalized measure of causal complexity as a 
    product of cyclomatic complexity and 1 + feedback density as follows:
    
    .. math::
    
        C = M*(1+D) = (E - N + 2P) * (1+(E_{loop}+N_{loop})/(E+N)),

    where :math:`C` is the causal complexity, :math:`M` is the cyclomatic 
    complexity, and :math:`D` is the feedback density. Cyclomatic complexity 
    reflects the number of linearly independent paths within a system 
    of interest and can be calculated using the number of edges 
    (:math:`E`), nodes (:math:`N`), and connected components (:math:`P`) 
    :cite:p:`ebert_cyclomatic_2016`. 
    In contrast, feedback density captures the fraction of edges 
    (:math:`E_{loop}`) and nodes (:math:`N_{loop}`) that are involved in at least one 
    feedback loop. As such, it reflects the potential for cyclic behaviors. 
    Jointly, the measure of causal complexity reflects the number of paths 
    through a system weighted to reflect those with feedback loops. 
    Thus, systems with more feedback density will have higher values 
    of causal complexity than those systems with lower feedback density.
